An Interactive Power BI Dashboard

# Analyzing Pizza Sales with Power BI Dashboard 📊🍕


🍕 What's it all about?
In this project, I dived deep into pizza sales data to gain valuable insights and create an interactive dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard provides a bird's-eye view of the pizza business and helps stakeholders make informed decisions.<br>

# 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Here are some of the important KPIs I incorporated into the dashboard:

**Total Revenue:** Keeping an eye on the total earnings to gauge the business's financial health.<br>
**Average Order Value:** Calculating the average amount spent per order, helping identify trends and customer behavior.<br>
**Total Pizzas Sold:** Tracking the overall quantity of pizzas sold over a specific period.<br>
**Total Orders:** Monitoring the number of orders processed within the chosen timeframe.<br>
**Average Pizza per Order:** Understanding how many pizzas, on average, are ordered per transaction.<br>

# 📅 Daily and Monthly Trends
The dashboard features visualizations that showcase the daily and monthly trends for total orders. These trends help in identifying popular ordering days and seasonal variations, providing crucial insights for sales strategies.

# 🍕 Pizza Category and Size Analysis
With the dashboard, stakeholders can quickly understand the percentage of sales attributed to each pizza category and size. This analysis aids in identifying the most popular choices among customers.

# 🏆 Top 5 and Bottom 5 Pizzas
To further assist decision-making, I implemented functionalities to display the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders. Identifying best-sellers and underperforming items can lead to targeted improvements.

# 💡 Power BI Functionality Showcased
Throughout the project, I made the most of various Power BI features, including:

**DAX Functions:** Utilizing powerful DAX functions to calculate and analyze data effectively.<br>
**Calculation Columns:** Creating custom columns to derive specific insights not available in the raw data.<br>
**Filtering:** Implementing filters to allow users to explore data based on their preferences.<br>
**Conditional Formatting:** Using formatting to visually highlight important metrics and trends.<br>
